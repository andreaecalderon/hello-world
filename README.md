Test for Technical Learning Specialist Interview Prep

### About me

My name is ***Andrea Calderon***, 
I'm applying for the *Techincal Learning Specialist* position at Brightcove. 

One of my favorite writers is Sylvia Plath. *Why?* 
Because she wrote **The Bell Jar** and she also wrote this: 
> Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all Iâ€™ve taken for granted.
